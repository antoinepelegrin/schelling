Implementation of the Schelling model for segregation (http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/)

You will be asked to choose a value for the population (0 -> 0.5 or 1 -> 0.9) and a value for the satisfaction threshold (0 -> 3 or 1 -> 4),
after which the animation should start. 

To advance to the next iteration, press the SPACE BAR. 

I chose a number of iteration that is quite high. You can exit at anytime by pressing CTLR + C.
